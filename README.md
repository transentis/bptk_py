# Business Prototyping Toolkit for Python

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/transentis/bptk_py/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/transentis/bptk_py)

__System Dynamics and Agent-based Modeling in Python__

The Business Prototyping Toolkit for Python (BPTK-Py) is a computational modeling framework that enables you to build simulation models using System Dynamics (SD) and/or agent-based modeling (ABM) natively in Python and manage simulation scenarios with ease.

Next to providing the necessary SD and ABM language constructs to build simulation models directly in Python, the framework also includes a compiler for transpiling System Dynamics models conforming to the XMILE standard into Python code.

This means you can build models in a XMILE-compatible visual modeling environment (such as [Stella](https://www.iseesystems.com) or [iThink](https://www.iseesystems.com)) and then use them _independently_ in an Python environment.

The best way to get started with BPTK-Py is to read the [Quickstart](https://bptk.transentis.com/quickstart/quickstart.html) that is part ot the extensive [online documentation](https://bptk.transentis.com). The Quickstart provides a _single page_ overview of all the computational modeling techniques supported by BPTK.


## Main Features

*   The objective of the framework is to let the modeller concentrate on building simulation models by providing a seamless interface for managing model settings and scenarios and for plotting simulation results.
*   The BPTK-Py framework supports System Dynamics models in XMILE Format, native SD models using a domain-specific language for System Dynamics (SD DSL) and native Agent-based models. You can also build hybrid SD-ABM-Models natively in Python.
*   All plotting is done using [Matplotlib](https://www.matplotlib.org).
*   Simulation results are returned as [Pandas dataframes](https://pandas.pydata.org) and thus can easily be used for analytics.
*   Model settings and scenarios are kept in JSON files. These settings are automatically loaded by the framework upon initialization, as are the model classes themselves. This makes interactive modeling, coding and testing very painless, especially if using the Jupyter notebook environment.

## Getting Help

BPTK-Py is developed and maintained by [transentis labs](https://www.transentis.com/business-prototyping-toolki/en/).

The first place to go to for help and installation instructions is the [online documentation](https://bptk.transentis.com).

The [Quickstart](https://bptk.transentis.com/quickstart/quickstart.html) provides a _single page_ overview of all the modeling techniques supported by BPTK.

The online documentation is generated from an extensive set of Jupyter notebooks, the __BPTK Tutorial__. The tutorial is available as a [git repository](https://github.com/transentis/bptk_py_tutorial) on GitHub.

Our [Business Prototyping Toolkit Meetup Group](https://www.transentis.com/business-prototyping-toolkit-meetup/en/) gathers online regularly. This is a good place to see BPTK in action, ask questions and suggest new features. We record every session and you can _view past recordings_ on the [meetup homepage](https://www.transentis.com/resources/business-prototyping-toolkit-meetup).

We used BPTK to build our implementation of the infamous [Beer Distribution Game](https://beergame.transentis.com).

Our [beergame repository](https://github.com/transentis/bptk_py_tutorial/tree/master/model_library/beergame) contains Jupyter notebooks that analyse the Beergame in-depth and also provides XMILE, SD DSL and Agent-based versions of the Beergame.

### 1.1.12
*   SD-DSL: Fixed a bug that caused converter equations (subtraction and division) to be computed incorrectly.

*   Visualisation for SD-DSL elements now follows conventions to work properly with Matplotlib 3.3+

### 1.1.10
*   Visualisation using matplotlib now follows conventions to work properly with Matplotlib 3.3+

### 1.1.9
*   SD-DSL: System Dynamics element such as converters did not implement comparison operators (">", "<", ">=", "==", "!="). They have been added

### 1.1.8
*   Another bugfix for series renaming. Simplified the code for renaming by using Pandas' standard method ``rename``

### 1.1.7
*   Bugfix for ``plot_scenarios``: The ``series_names`` replacer did not work properly for when only one scenario manager / scenario is given.

### 1.1.6
*   Bugfix for XMILE compiler: A little error in the parser prevented certain models being parsed correctly
*   Bugfix for ``plot_scenarios``: The new error messages showed up for Agent based models although the scenarios were present

### 1.1.5
*   The XMILE compiler is a great tool that handles model conversion from XMILE SD Models to Python. For compatibility and readability, we change the equation names to camelCasing upon conversion. This might be confusing for some users. That's why we decided to give you a new function call that lists all equations for System Dynamics Models. Simply run ``bptk.list_equations()`` (optionally add scenario manager(s) and scenario(s)) and get an overview over available model elements. More details [in our documentation](https://bptk.transentis.com/en/latest/docs/xmile/how-to/how_to_working_with_XMILE/how_to_working_with_XMILE.html).
*   Improved error messages. In previous versions, a long error trace was printed when an equation was not found. Now you get a neat error message output wiht hints as to why the plotting failed.
*   If an equation / scenario / scenario manager is not found, ``BPTK_Py`` gives hints on which similar equations / scenarios / scenario managers might be available for use.
*   Register XMILE models without having to follow the directory structure: ``BPTK_PY`` scans the ``scenarios`` folder upon startup to find new scenario managers and XMILE / ABM models. We developed a simpler way to add simulation models during runtime without having to add scenarios beforehand: ``bptk.register_model("<path_to_itmx_stmx>","<modelname>")``. You can then easily simulate the model just as you're used to.

### 1.1.4
XMILE equations make use of double-quote enclosed identifiers in case it actually looks like a function call. For example, ``100*"Identifier(enclosed)"`` is a valid equation where one element (stock/flow) is called ``Identifier(enclosed)``. However, we were not able to parse this, until now.
Update BPTK-Py using the new update mechanism: [documentation](https://bptk.transentis.com/en/latest/docs/usage/installation.html#keeping-bptk-py-up-to-date)

### 1.1.3
We figured that the update mechanisms via ``pip`` might be confusing sometimes, especially for non-programmers. This is
why we decided to implement an update mechanism. Details are available in the [documentation](https://bptk.transentis.com/en/latest/docs/usage/installation.html#keeping-bptk-py-up-to-date)

### 1.1.2
*   Bugfix to (XMILE) SD Compiler: Added support for array expressions within function calls. We had trouble with equations that contain another expression within a function call. E.g. ``DELAY(arrayedElement[1,2]*5, 1, 1)`` was not supported.
*   Improvement to (XMILE) SD Compiler: Removed replacement of currency symbols (``€``, ``$`` etc.) and percentage signs with abbreviations. We had implemented this in earlier releases but figured it leads to confusion with modellers.

### 1.1.1
*   The SD DSL now differentiates flows and biflows. Simply add a biflow using ```biflow = model.biflow(<name>)```.
*   The SD DSL now supports: RANDOM, IF, NOT, AND, OR, NAN, SQRT, ROUND and all trigonometric and statistical builtins you know from XMILE. Furthermore the operators support Comparison Operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=) and the modulo operator (x % y).
    *   RANDOM: ``converter.equation = sd.Random(<min>, <max>)`` draws a uniformly distributed float random number between <min> and <max>
    *   ROUND: ``converter.equation = sd.Round(sd.random(0,1),2))`` rounds a random number between 0 and 1 to a 2 digit float
    *   IF: ```converter.equation = sd.If( <condition>, <then> , <else> ) ``` corresponds to ```IF <condition> THEN <then> ELSE <else>```. Each term inside the IF clause can be a SD term again. Example for a valid If clause: ``equation = sd.If(sd.time()>10,sd.random(1,2), 100)``
    *   AND/OR: ```sd.Or(<left hand side>, <right hand side>)``` and ```sd.And(<left hand side>, <right hand side>)``` for multiple conditions
    *   NOT: Use ```sd.Not(<condition>)``` for "not" conditions, e.g:  ```sd.If(sd.Not(sd.time()>10), 1, 0 )```
    *   NAN / INF / PI: ``sd.nan()`` returns a NAN value, ``sd.Inf()`` gives you the infinity value, ```sd.pi()``` returns the number pi.
    *   SQRT: ``sd.sqrt(<value of function>)`` computes the square root
    *   SIN / TAN / COS: ``sd.sin(x) / sd.cos(x) / sd.tan(x)`` for sinus, cosinus or tangent of x (radians) and of course we also support ARCCOS, ARCSIN, ARCTAN with the same syntax
    *   SINWAVE / COSWAVE: ``sd.sinwave(amplitude,period)`` / ``sd.coswave(amplitude,period)`` to generate sine / cosine waves with given amplitude and period
    *   More documentation and how to use the __statistical (random numbers from various distributions) and trigonometric operators__ can be found in our [online documentation](https://bptk.transentis.com/en/latest/docs/sd-dsl/in-depth/in_depth_sd_dsl_functions/in_depth_sd_dsl_functions.html)
*   We fixed a bug that caused BPTK to crash when an XMILE model was updated while BPTK was monitoring it
*   We fixed SINWAVE in the XMILE transpiler and added support for COSWAVE

### 1.1.0
*   We are supporting all XMILE operators now. Note that random numbers with seed are **never** the same as when using Stella Architect's seed! This is due to different random number generators in Python and Stella. We neither support the min / max arguments for the random number operators. Refer to the [documentation](https://bptk.transentis.com/en/latest/docs/usage/limitations.html))
*   RUNCOUNT and SENSIRUNCOUNT are not supported and support is not planned.

### 1.0.2
*   Bugfix release: Better support for multidimensional arrays

### 1.0.1

*   Bugfix release: Fixed an issue with plot_lookup

### 1.0.0

*   SD Compiler: Added new operators
    *   Arrays and Array Operators (MIN, MAX, SUM, MEAN, SELF, SIZE, PROD)
    *   Statistical operators (COMBINATIONS, BETA, BINOMIAL, FACTORIAL, GAMMA, GAMMALN, EXPRND, GEOMETRIC)
    *   Trigonometric operators (ARCSIN, ARCCOS, ARCTAN)
*   The ``plot_scenarios`` API now supports array calls such as ``stock[*]`` or ``stock[dim1,dim2]``
*   SD DSL: ABS, DT, PULSE, STARTTIME, STOPTIME
